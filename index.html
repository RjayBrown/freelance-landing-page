							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Summary</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								The purpose of this Service Agreement is to establish clear
								terms and conditions. We'll always do our best to fulfill your
								needs and meet your expectations, so you won't find any
								complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text.
								What we do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the
								future.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">
								Both parties agree to:
							</h3>
							<h4 class="heading-minor">You:</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								You have the authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of
								yourself, your company or your organization. You'll give us the
								assets and information we tell you we need to complete the
								project and provide it in the formats we ask for. You'll review
								our work, and provide feedback and approvals in a timely manner.
								Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set
								together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set
								within this agreement.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Us:</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed
								with you and we'll do it all in a professional and timely
								manner. We'll endeavor to meet every deadline that's set and on
								top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you
								give us.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Building the Project</h3>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Layout & Design</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt
								to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We use
								design tools to build samples (color, texture and typography)
								from your requirements, and we will provide visuals to indicate
								a creative direction for your finalized layout. We refer to this
								as 'atmosphere'.
							</p>
							<p class="small minor card">
								You'll have many opportunities to review our work. We'll have
								scheduled meetings throughout the project (via Zoom or Google
								Meet) and snapshots of the project under development, where you
								will be able to view the different build stages and provide
								feedback.
							</p>
							<p class="small minor card">
								If, at any stage, you are not happy with the direction our work
								is taking and you change your mind about what you want to be
								delivered, you'll notify us in writing and we will immediately
								stop work at that point and terminate this agreement.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Text Content</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								Unless agreed separately, we're not responsible for inputting
								text or images into your content management system or creating
								every page on your website. We do provide professional
								copywriting and editing services, so if you'd like us to create
								new content or input content for you, we can provide a separate
								estimate for that.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Graphics and Photographs</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital
								format (SVG or EPS). You should supply photographs in a high
								resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock
								photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you'd like us to
								search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate
								estimate for that.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Web Development</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We deliver web page types developed from HTML markup for
								structure, CSS stylesheets for styling and client-side and
								server-side JavaScript for user interactions and the website's
								functionality.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Browser Testing</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website
								look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on
								devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that
								a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the
								capabilities of a browser or device.
							</p>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers
								including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome),
								Microsoft (Edge), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We'll also test to
								ensure that people who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for
								Windows get an appropriate experience. We won't test in other
								older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an
								enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate
								estimate for that.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Mobile Browser Testing</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in
								ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate
								to the capabilities of the device they're using. We test our
								designs in:
							</p>
							<h4 class="heading-minor">Included Browsers</h4>
							<ul class="list">
								<li><strong>iOS: Safari, Google Chrome</strong></li>
								<li>
									<strong>Android: Google Chrome on Android Emulator</strong>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We won't test in Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android
								devices, Windows or other mobile browsers unless we agreed
								separately. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a
								separate estimate for that.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Technical Support</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We're not a website hosting company so we don't offer support
								for website hosting, email or other services relating to
								hosting. You may already have professional hosting and you might
								even manage that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you
								don't, we can set up an account for you at one of our preferred
								hosting providers. We can set up your site on a server, plus any
								statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide
								a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and
								management of that server will be up to you.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Improving SEO</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We don't guarantee improvements to your website's search engine
								ranking, but the web pages that we develop are easily accessible
								to search engines with the use of HTML semantic elements. If you
								need advanced SEO and accessibility features (using WCAG &
								WAI-ARIA specification & microdata), we can provide a separate
								estimate for that.
							</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Changes and Revisions</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The
								price at the beginning of this agreement is based on the scope
								of work required to accomplish everything you've told us you
								want to achieve, and timelines provided in the proposal. We're
								happy to be flexible, and if you want to change your mind or add
								anything new, that won't be a problem as we'll provide a
								separate estimate for that.

							<h4 class="heading-minor">You:</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								You guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork
								you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission
								to use them. When you provide text, images or other artwork to
								us, you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Us:</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are
								either owned by us or we've obtained permission to provide them
								to you. When we provide text, images or other artwork to you, we
								agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you're
								using their intellectual property. Provided you've paid for the
								work and that this agreement hasn't been terminated, we'll
								assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:
							</p>
							<p class="small minor card">
								You'll own the website we design for you plus the visual
								elements that we create for it. We'll give you source files and
								finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we're
								not required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property
								rights of text, images, site specification and data you
								provided, unless someone else owns them.
							</p>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We'll own any intellectual property rights we've developed prior
								to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for
								by you. We'll own the unique combination of these elements that
								constitutes a complete design and we'll license its use to you,
								exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we
								agree otherwise.

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Displaying Our Work</h4>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display
								all aspects of our creative work, including sketches,
								work-in-progress designs and the completed project on our
								portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and
								in books.

							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">Payment Schedule</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We're sure you understand how important it is as a small
								business that payments are made on time and in full. The
								schedule is also included below for clarity.
							</p>

							<h4 class="heading-minor">Project Phases & Required Payments</h4>
							<ul class="list">
								<li>
									<strong>Planning & Design: Initial Deposit (20%)</strong>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Build: Second Payment (50%)</strong></li>
								<li>
									<strong>Deployment: Final Payment (30%)</strong>

							<h3 class="heading-small section-title">
								Acceptable Payment Methods
							</h3>
							<p class="small minor card">
								We want to make payments easy to understand, and as convenient
								as possible using electronic invoicing and several remote
								payment options to make payments as convenient as possible.
								Payments shall be made on time, and with your preferred method,
								both will be clearly defined in the proposal. All payments are
								non-refundable, and we both agree to a grace period of five
								business days from the due date. You agree to pay an additional
								$100 late fee starting on the sixth business day, and we will
								not be required to continue work after the grace period until
								payment is received.

								Neither of us can transfer this agreement to anyone else without
								the other's permission. We both agree that we'll adhere to all
								relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities
								under this agreement and not cause the other to breach any
								relevant laws or regulations. This agreement stays in place and
								need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this
								agreement becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts
								of it remain in place.

					<section>
						<h3>Summary</h3>
						<p>
							We'll always do our best to fulfill your needs and meet your
							expectations, and it's important to have a Service Agreement and
							establish clear terms and conditions. You won't find any
							complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. What
							we do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What do both parties agree to?</h3>
						<h4>You</h4>
						<p>
							You have the authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of
							yourself, your company or your organization. You'll give us the
							assets and information we tell you we need to complete the project
							and provide it in the formats we ask for. You'll review our work,
							and provide feedback and approvals in a timely manner. Deadlines
							work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set together.
							You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end
							of this agreement.
						</p>

						<h4>Us</h4>
						<p>
							We have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed
							with you and we'll do it all in a professional and timely manner.
							We'll endeavor to meet every deadline that's set and on top of
							that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Building the Website</h3>

						<h4>Wireframe & Design</h4>
						<p>
							We create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt
							to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create
							structure iteratively using design tools to build sample concepts
							from your requirements, and we will use HTML and CSS for visuals
							to indicate a creative direction (color, texture and typography).
							We refer to this as 'atmosphere'.
						</p>
						<p>
							You'll have many opportunities to review our work. We'll have
							scheduled meetings throughout the project (via Zoom or Google
							Meet) and snapshots of the development site, where you will be
							able to view the different build stages and provide feedback.
						</p>
						<p>
							If, at any stage, you are not happy with the direction our work is
							taking and you change your mind about what you want to be
							delivered, you'll notify us in writing and we will immediately
							stop work at that point and terminate this agreement.
						</p>

						<h4>Text Content</h4>
						<p>
							Unless agreed separately, we're not responsible for inputting text
							or images into your content management system or creating every
							page on your website. We do provide professional copywriting and
							editing services, so if you'd like us to create new content or
							input content for you, we can provide a separate estimate for
							that.
						</p>

						<h4>Graphics and Photographs</h4>
						<p>
							You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital
							format (SVG or EPS). You should supply photographs in a high
							resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs,
							we can suggest stock libraries. If you'd like us to search for
							photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
						</p>

						<h4>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>
						<p>
							We deliver web page types developed from HTML markup for
							structure, CSS stylesheets for styling and client-side and
							server-side JavaScript for user interactions and the website's
							functionality.
						</p>

						<h4>Browser Testing</h4>
						<p>
							Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look
							the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with
							different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's
							experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities
							of a browser or device.
						</p>
						<p>
							We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers
							including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft
							(Edge), Mozilla Firefox and Opera. We'll also test to ensure that
							people who use Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 for Windows get an
							appropriate experience. We won't test in other older browsers
							unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an
							older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.
						</p>

						<h4>Mobile Browser Testing</h4>
						<p>
							Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in
							ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate to
							the capabilities of the device they're using. We test our designs
							in:
						</p>
						<ul class="list">
							<li>iOS 9: Safari, Google Chrome</li>
							<li>Android: Google Chrome on Android Emulator</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							We won't test in Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android
							devices, Windows or other mobile browsers unless we agreed
							separately. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a
							separate estimate for that.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Technical Support</h3>
						<p>
							We're not a website hosting company so we don't offer support for
							website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting. You
							may already have professional hosting and you might even manage
							that hosting in-house; if you do, great. If you don't, we can set
							up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers.
							We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software
							such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate
							for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will
							be up to you.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
						<p>
							We don't guarantee improvements to your website's search engine
							ranking, but the web pages that we develop are easily accessible
							to search engines with the use of HTML semantic elements. If you
							need advanced SEO and accessibility features (using WAI-ARIA
							specification & microdata), we can provide a separate estimate for
							that.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Changes and Revisions</h3>
						<p>
							We don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price
							at the beginning of this agreement is based on the scope of work
							to accomplish everything you've told us you want to achieve, and
							timelines provided in the proposal. We're happy to be flexible,
							and if you want to change your mind or add anything new, that
							won't be a problem as we'll provide a separate estimate for that.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Legal</h3>

						<h4>Indemnification</h4>
						<p>
							We'll carry out our work in accordance with good industry practice
							and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with
							relevant experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							That said, we can't guarantee that our work will be error-free and
							so we can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages,
							including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental,
							consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of
							them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Your liability to us will also be limited to the amount of fees
							payable under this agreement and you won't be liable to us or any
							third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or
							other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if we've
							advised you of them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Finally, if any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful,
							void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall
							be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the
							validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
						</p>

						<h4>Intellectual Property Rights</h4>
						<h4>You</h4>
						<p>
							You guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork
							you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission
							to use them. When you provide text, images or other artwork to us,
							you agree to protect us from any claim by a third party that we're
							using their intellectual property.
						</p>

						<h4>Us</h4>
						<p>
							We guarantee that all elements of the work we deliver to you are
							either owned by us or we've obtained permission to provide them to
							you. When we provide text, images or other artwork to you, we
							agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you're
							using their intellectual property. Provided you've paid for the
							work and that this agreement hasn't been terminated, we'll assign
							all intellectual property rights to you as follows:
						</p>
						<p>
							You'll own the website we design for you plus the visual elements
							that we create for it. We'll give you source files and finished
							files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we're not
							required to keep a copy. You own all intellectual property rights
							of text, images, site specification and data you provided, unless
							someone else owns them.
						</p>
						<p>
							We'll own any intellectual property rights we've developed prior
							to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by
							you. We'll own the unique combination of these elements that
							constitutes a complete design and we'll license its use to you,
							exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we
							agree otherwise.
						</p>

						<h4>Displaying Our Work</h4>
						<p>
							We love to show off our work, so we reserve the right to display
							all aspects of our creative work, including sketches,
							work-in-progress designs and the completed project on our
							portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in
							books.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Payment Schedule</h3>
						<p>
							We're sure you understand how important it is as a small business
							that payments are made on time and in full. The schedule is also
							included below for clarity.
						</p>

						<h4>Work</h4>
						<ul class="list">
							<li><strong>Planning: Initial Deposit (20%)</strong></li>
							<li><strong>Design/Build: Payment 2 (40%)</strong></li>
							<li>
								<strong>Testing/Launch: Final Payment (40%)</strong>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3 class="major card">Acceptable Payment Methods</h3>
						<p>
							We want to make payments easy to understand, and as convenient as
							possible using electronic invoicing (Square) and several remote
							payment options (Square, Zelle, ApplePay). Payments will be due on
							the dates outlined in the proposal and payment schedule. All
							payments are non-refundable, and we both agree to a grace period
							of five business days from the due dates outlined in the proposal.
							You agree to pay an additional $100 late fee on the sixth business
							day, and we will not be required to continue work after the grace
							period until payment is received.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>But where's all the horrible small print?</h3>
						<p>
							Just like a parking ticket, neither of us can transfer this
							agreement to anyone else without the other's permission.
						</p>
						<p>
							We both agree that we'll adhere to all relevant laws and
							regulations in relation to our activities under this agreement and
							not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.
						</p>
						<p>
							This agreement stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some
							reason one part of this agreement becomes invalid or
							unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and
							this agreement is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of
							the
